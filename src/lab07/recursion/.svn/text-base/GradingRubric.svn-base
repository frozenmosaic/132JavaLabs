132 Lab Grading Rubric - Recursion Exercises

  33 / 36	- Correctness

 	PyramidBoxCount											yes	no
	  Base case for even pyramid base size is correct.		X
	  Base case for odd pyramid base size is correct.		X
	  Recursive case is correct.							X

	Exponentiation											yes	no
	  Base case is correct.										X
	  	* The base case should handle n==0 because n can
	  	  be a non-negative integer.
	  Recursive case for even exponent is correct.			X
	  Recursive case for odd exponent is correct.			X

	Array Sum												yes	no
	  Base case is correct.									X
	  Recursive case is correct.							X

	Sierpinski												yes	no
	  Base case (order 1) is correct.						X
	  Order 2 is correct.									X
	  Order 3 is correct.									X
	  Order 5 is correct.									X
		
  2 / 3 	- Code Quality
	Array Sum												yes	no
	  Uses recursive helper method for better efficiency.	X
	
	* In ArraySum, the start++ and end-- statements have no 
	  effect on the operation of the method and should be 
	  removed.  Similarly, there is no need to add finalSum
	  to itself, just set it to the rest.
	  
  1.5 / 2 	- Documentation / Readability
  	* You might choose a more descriptive name for the helper method
  	  in the ArraySum class.
  	* Be sure to include your name at the top of your files.
  	
  7 / 11	- Testing Quality

 	PyramidBoxCount											yes	no
	  At least one test case for each base case.			X
	  At least one test case for recursive case.			X
	  Test data and assertions are well chosen				X

	Exponentiation											yes	no
	  At least one test case for base case.					X
	  At least one test case for each recursive case.		X
	  Test data and assertions are well chosen				X
  
	Array Sum												yes	no
	  At least one test case for base case.						X
	  	* It would be good to test the base case independently
	  	  of the recursive cases.  I.e. test with an array of
	  	  size 0 and one of size 1.
	  	  
	  At least one test case for recursive case.			X
	  Test data and assertions are well chosen				X
	  
	  * It would be a good idea to split your test cases apart so that
	    the base cases are tested independently from your recursive cases.
	    
	  * Every assertion should have a descriptive failure message that
	    will help in finding the problem if the test fails.
