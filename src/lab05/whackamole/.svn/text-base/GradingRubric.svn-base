132 Lab Grading Rubric - Whack-a-Mole

  30 / 32	- Correctness
	
	Model Correctness:																yes	no
	  	Constructor correctly places one mole at any location on the board.			X
	  	whack method moves mole to any location when hole is whacked.				X
	  	whack method moves mole to any location when mole is whacked.				X
	  	whack method properly updates score.											X
	  	whack method correctly notifies observer.									X
	
  	View/Controller Correctness:													yes	no
	  	GUI elements constructed and laid out correctly.							X
		ActionListeners invoke methods in the model to reflect user actions.		X
 		update method modifies GUI elements to reflect state of model.				X
    
  4 / 5 	- Code Quality															yes	no
	Uses x,y coordinate for mole (not 2d array)										X
	GUI element layout is well organized (one helper method per box)				X

	* You could eliminate some duplicate code in WhackAMoleGUI by creating
	  a helper method that takes the row as a parameter and returns a JPanel 
	  containing all of the buttons in the row.

	* The Icons for the mole and hole should probably be private static final 
	  fields since they are used in several places and never change.
	  
	* Nice idea to factor out the setIcons method in WhackAMoleGUI.
		
  2.5 / 3 	- Documentation / Readability
	* Constructors should have a JavaDoc comment describing their operation
	  and including a @param tag explaining the purpose of each parameter.
	  (See added constructor in WhackAMoleModel)
	    
  2 / 3	- Testing Quality
	* Each assert statement should contain a useful message describing what happened 
	  when the test failed. That message is displayed by JUnit when the test fails and 
	  is helpful in determining what went wrong, particularly when the tests are run weeks, 
	  months or years after the code is originally written.

	 * You need several additional tests for this to be a thorough set of tests:
	   - There should be tests for the whack method that check:
	     - that the score is updated correctly when a hole is whacked
	     - that the score is updated correctly when a mole is whacked
	     	    
  0 / 0 	- Bonus Features
  		x / 2 - Timer to move mole every 3 seconds.
  		x / 3 - JRadio buttons for level change timer duration
  		x / 1 - JUnit test that WhackAMoleModel notifies observers when whack is called.
